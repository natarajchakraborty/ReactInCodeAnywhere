# An attempt in making react work in Code Anywhere

Basic steps:

I followed the velocity360 chat-room with firebase tutorial, most the of the setup is as shown in the tutorial, accespt the following things:

* I started with prebuilt 'Node' stack environment in CodeAnywhere
* Installed Webpack gloabally first.
* Installed Express globally.
* Then installed all the project dependencies locally as shown in the tutotial.
* Also installed webpack locally for the project.
* Created a server.js file which uses express to serves file, a http server listning to 0.0.0.0 and port 8080.
* Started the server, thats all for the specific steps to make this work in codeanywhere environment.
